# esp32-c3-adblock

**English** · [Русский](README_RU.md)

A **Pi-hole-style DNS ad-blocker** that runs on a **$2 ESP32-C3** — *no PSRAM required*.

> 📰 Featured on [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/clever-hacker-fits-537-000-domains-in-a-tiny-usd5-esp32-ad-blocking-dongle-firmware-uses-only-around-50kb-of-ram-and-can-answer-blocked-lookups-in-10-milliseconds), [XDA Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/this-tiny-esp32-powered-gadget-blocks-537000-domains-only-uses-50kb-of-ram/), and [Korben](https://korben.info/en/half-million-ad-blocking-domains-50kb-ram-esp32.html).

The trick everyone misses: you don't need to keep the blocklist in RAM. Store the
domains as **sorted 40-bit hashes in flash** and binary-search them. 140,000+ domains
fit in ~0.7 MB of flash and are matched in ~10 ms, using **~50 KB of RAM**.

```
query in ──▶ extract domain ──▶ FNV-1a hash (+ parent suffixes)
         ──▶ binary-search the flash hash table
              ├─ hit  ──▶ answer 0.0.0.0   (sinkholed)
              └─ miss ──▶ forward to upstream resolver, relay the reply
```

## Why this is interesting

Most ESP32 DNS sinkholes load the blocklist (domain *strings*) into RAM, so they
demand PSRAM. This project stores fixed **5-byte (40-bit) hashes in flash** instead:

| | string-in-RAM approach | this (hash-in-flash) |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware | ESP32 + PSRAM (~$8) | ESP32-C3, no PSRAM (~$2) |
| 141k domains | ~2.5 MB of RAM | **0.67 MB of flash** |
| RAM used | most of it | **~50 KB** |
| Lookup | string compare | ~18 flash reads (~10 ms incl. WiFi RTT) |
| Collisions | n/a | 0 at 141k (1 at 537k) |

**Why 40 bits?** It's the sweet spot for this flash budget. Collisions follow the
birthday bound — at 141k domains you get ~0, at 537k about 1 (i.e. one unlucky
domain gets over-blocked). Dropping to 32 bits would save 20% of the flash but
cost ~7 collisions at 250k; going to 64 bits wastes 3 bytes per domain to solve
a problem you don't have.

The same trick works on bigger chips — it isn't a C3 workaround. On a 16 MB
ESP32-S3 these hashes hold **~2.7M domains** vs ~466k for strings in 8 MB of
PSRAM. Hashes in flash beat strings in PSRAM basically everywhere; the C3 just
makes it undeniable.

## Hardware

- Any **ESP32-C3** board (tested on a C3 SuperMini), 4 MB flash, **no PSRAM needed**
- Classic **ESP32** (DevKit / WROOM, 4 MB) also builds: `pio run -e esp32dev -t upload` (community-contributed, compile-tested; the C3 is the tested target)
- Power it from a **stable USB source** (a phone charger or your router's USB port).
  Cheap/loose USB-C→A adapters can brown out the radio during WiFi transmit.
- A **USB-A → USB-C dongle** lets it plug straight into the spare USB port on the
  back of most routers — no power supply, no extra box.

### Enclosure

A printable case for the C3 SuperMini: [`hardware/esp32-c3-supermini-enclosure.stl`](hardware/esp32-c3-supermini-enclosure.stl)

Printing notes:
- No supports needed; 0.2 mm layers, ~15% infill is plenty.
- **Keep the antenna end clear.** The C3's PCB antenna is the zig-zag trace on the
  short edge opposite the USB-C port — don't bury it in solid plastic or put metal
  near it, or your RSSI will suffer.
- Leave the vents open: the board idles around 45–55 °C.

## Build & flash (PlatformIO)

One USB flash to get going — after that, **firmware and blocklist both update over WiFi** (see below).

> ⚠️ Use a **current PlatformIO** — the VSCode PlatformIO extension's bundled core, or
> `pip install -U platformio` in a venv. The distro/apt `platformio` package (e.g. 4.3.4) is
> too old and fails with `AttributeError: ... 'resultcallback'` (issue #4). A one-click browser installer is on the way (hosting TBD).

```bash
# 1. copy the secrets template (gitignored, stays local) and edit it:
#    - WIFI_SSID / WIFI_PASS are optional — leave the placeholders and use the
#      on-device setup portal instead (below).
#    - WEB_USER / WEB_PASS / OTA_PASS are NOT optional: they gate the dashboard's
#      state-changing endpoints (/ban, /addblock, /upload, /update, /setupdate,
#      /forgetwifi) and network OTA. Pick real values — these used to be wide
#      open to anyone on the LAN.
cp src/secrets.example.h src/secrets.h
#    then edit src/secrets.h

# 2. build the blocklist hash table (default = Hagezi Pro + StevenBlack +
#    Schakal RU AdList + AdGuard Russian; ~266k entries, RU sites stay usable)
python3 tools/build_blocklist.py data/blocklist.bin

# 3. flash firmware + the blocklist filesystem (the one and only USB flash)
pio run -t upload
pio run -t uploadfs

# 4. watch it boot, note the IP / open the dashboard
pio device monitor          # -> http://c3adblock.local
```

### Your own blocklists

`build_blocklist.py OUT.bin [SOURCE ...]` takes any mix of URLs and local files, in any of
these formats:

- **hosts files** — `0.0.0.0 ads.example.com tracker.example.com` (all domains on the line are included)
- **plain domain lists** — one domain per line
- **AdGuard / Adblock basic rules** — `||ads.example.com^` blocks, `@@||ok.example.com^`
  removes a domain (e.g. to mirror an AdGuard Home allowlist)

A blocked domain also blocks its subdomains. Rules a DNS hash list can't express (regex,
wildcards, `$` modifiers, cosmetic `##` rules) are skipped and counted. An `@@` rule only
un-blocks that exact entry — it can't carve a subdomain out of a blocked parent. If a source
can't be downloaded the build stops instead of silently producing a smaller list
(`--allow-missing` to override).

### WiFi setup (no re-flash needed)

If it can't connect (or you never set `secrets.h`), it starts an open access point
**`C3-AdBlock-XXXX`** with a captive portal — join it from a phone, pick your network,
type the password, done. To move it to a new network later: click **Forget WiFi** on
the dashboard, or hold the **BOOT** button while powering on, and the setup portal
comes back. (`/forgetwifi` requires auth now, so it's no longer a bare URL you can
just visit — see Security below.)

## Over-the-air updates (no more USB)

The dashboard at **http://c3adblock.local** does it all:

- **Blocklist** — drop a freshly built `blocklist.bin` into *Blocklist → Upload*, or set a
  URL under *Remote auto-update* and the device pulls a prebuilt `blocklist.bin`
  on a schedule. A fresh default list is rebuilt **every day** by GitHub Actions and
  published at a stable URL, so pasting this once keeps a device current on its own:
  `https://github.com/hybhyyb/esp32-c3-adblock/releases/download/blocklist/blocklist.bin`
- **Firmware** — upload `.pio/build/c3/firmware.bin` under *Firmware → OTA update* (needs a
  dual-OTA partition table; the default single-app table flashes firmware over USB instead).
  Or push over WiFi from the CLI:
  ```bash
  pio run -t upload --upload-port c3adblock.local --upload-protocol espota
  ```

**4 MB flash tradeoff:** this repo ships a **single-app** `partitions.csv` — no network
firmware OTA (flash firmware over USB), which frees **2.63 MB** for blocklists (**~525k
domains max**) and leaves room for the daily auto-update to write a fresh list alongside
the live one. Prefer network firmware OTA? Switch to a dual-OTA table — two app slots
leave ~1.3 MB for the blocklist (**~250k domains max**).

## Security

The dashboard's read-only view (`/`, `/stats.json`) stays open, but every
state-changing endpoint requires **HTTP Basic Auth** (`WEB_USER`/`WEB_PASS` from
`secrets.h`):

- `/ban`, `/addblock`, `/unblock`, `/forgetwifi`
- `/upload`, `/update` (blocklist and firmware OTA)
- `/setupdate`, `/fetchnow`

Network OTA (`ArduinoOTA`, e.g. `pio run -t upload --upload-port c3adblock.local
--upload-protocol espota`) requires `OTA_PASS` from the same file.

Without this, anyone who could reach the device on the LAN could reflash it
with arbitrary firmware or rewrite the blocklist with zero credentials — worth
knowing given the device sits in the path of every DNS query on your network.
Custom blocked-domain names are also HTML-escaped before being rendered on the
dashboard, closing a stored-XSS path where a domain string containing markup
(added via `/addblock`) would otherwise execute in the viewing browser.

**Basic Auth here is a LAN-trust-boundary control, not encryption.** Everything
is plain HTTP on :80 — this chip has no realistic budget to run a TLS server.
Basic Auth credentials are base64 (not encrypted) and sent on every authenticated
request; anyone who can already sniff your LAN traffic (open/guest WiFi, ARP
spoofing) can read them off the wire. This hardens against the common case —
another device on your network hitting the API with no credentials at all, or a
browser tab CSRF'ing it — not against an on-path network attacker.

**CSRF via cached Basic Auth:** browsers auto-attach cached Basic Auth
credentials to *any* subsequent request to an already-authenticated origin —
including one triggered by a totally unrelated page the same browser visits
later (e.g. `<img src="http://c3adblock.local/forgetwifi">`, no JS required).
That would let any webpage silently drive this API once you've logged into the
dashboard once, regardless of who's on your LAN. Every mutating endpoint above
now also requires a custom `X-Requested-With: c3-adblock` header, which a plain
`<img>`/auto-submitted `<form>` CSRF can't attach (only same-origin `fetch()`
can, which is what the dashboard's own JS does) — this is why `/forgetwifi` is
no longer a bare URL you can visit directly; use the dashboard button instead.

**Default credentials:** if `secrets.h` still has the placeholder
`CHANGE_ME_WEB_PASSWORD` / `CHANGE_ME_OTA_PASSWORD` values from
`secrets.example.h`, the device boots with a "password" that's public (it's
sitting in this repo's example file). The firmware logs a warning over serial
and shows a banner on the dashboard when this is the case — but it will still
boot and run, so don't skip setting real values in `secrets.h` before trusting
this on a network you don't fully control.

Out of scope for now: the WiFi setup portal's access point (`C3-AdBlock-XXXX`)
is still open (unencrypted) by design — it needs to be joinable without knowing
a password first. The real WiFi password you type into the portal is only as
safe as that local radio link during the brief setup window.

## Use it

Point a device's DNS at the C3's IP, or add it as a **secondary resolver** behind
your main DNS. Test:

```bash
dig @<c3-ip> doubleclick.net   # -> 0.0.0.0  (blocked)
dig @<c3-ip> github.com        # -> real IP  (forwarded)
```

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **ModemManager** (default on Fedora/Ubuntu) grabs `/dev/ttyACM0` and toggles
  DTR/RTS, which **resets the C3** and blocks serial. Fix:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop ModemManager
  echo 'ATTRS{idVendor}=="303a", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-esp-no-modemmanager.rules
  sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
  ```
- The C3's USB-Serial-JTAG console can swallow early boot output until the host
  connects (`while(!Serial)` helps).
- DNS clients add an **EDNS OPT** record; a blocked reply must contain only the
  question + answer (ANCOUNT=1, NSCOUNT=ARCOUNT=0) or it's malformed.

## Done / how it could grow

- ✅ Web dashboard — per-client block/allow counts, ban a client, add custom domains
- ✅ mDNS (`c3adblock.local`) for discovery
- ✅ OTA — firmware + blocklist update over WiFi, plus scheduled remote blocklist pulls
- ✅ Captive-portal WiFi setup (no hardcoded creds) + one-click browser web-installer
- ⬜ Bucketed prefix index — ~18 flash reads/lookup → ~1–2 (issue #3), the throughput win
- ⬜ Act as the DHCP server (hand itself out as DNS) for true plug-and-play
